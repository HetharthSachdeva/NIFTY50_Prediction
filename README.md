# Nifty Prediction Using LSTM

This project focuses on predicting the Nifty stock index using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. By leveraging historical stock market data and a robust deep learning architecture, the model aims to provide accurate predictions of future values in the Nifty index.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following libraries and frameworks:
- **Python 3.7+**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for building and training the LSTM model.
- **pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy** for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or later.
- Required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nifty-prediction.git
   cd nifty-prediction
   ```

2. Download and place your dataset (CSV or Excel format) into the project directory.

3. Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script to begin training.

### Usage

#### Running the Project:
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook in the project directory:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open the `Nifty_pred.ipynb` file.

3. Follow these steps in the notebook:
   - Load your dataset into the provided template.
   - Preprocess the data as instructed in the notebook.
   - Train the model using the given LSTM architecture.
   - Visualize the results.

4. Alternatively, run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python Nifty_pred.py
   ```

   The model will generate a graph comparing the predicted vs. actual stock index prices.

## Project Workflow

The project follows these key steps:

### Data Preprocessing:
- Import the historical stock data (e.g., Nifty index).
- Normalize the data for faster convergence and to reduce biases.
- Create a sliding window of past observations to train the model.

### LSTM Model Building:
- Use a Sequential API to create a deep learning model with stacked LSTM layers.
- Add Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
- Specify the input shape for the LSTM model.

### Model Training:
- Train the model on preprocessed data for a defined number of epochs.
- Save the trained model if needed.

### Evaluation and Visualization:
- Test the model's accuracy on unseen data.
- Plot predicted vs. actual values to assess performance.
